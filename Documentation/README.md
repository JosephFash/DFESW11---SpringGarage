# DFESW11 - SpringGarage

Why are we doing this?  

I'm doing this project as a final project for my practical to put what I've learnt regarding java, git, mysql and various other tools into practice.

How I expected the challenge to go?

I expected the challenge to go pretty well and I also anticipated that there will be some difficulties to sort out as is the case when it comes to working on major developement projects.

What went well?/What didn't go to plan?

I was able to get the main parts of the API completed and add queries that allowed for searching for specifics which was very good, however I did have some issues with initially working out the repo structure and also had some issues with the maven dependencies in the first part of the code.

Possible improvements for the future

In the future, I will try to make sure that I have a plan beforehand which I could follow which will be very helpful for mitigating any issues that may crop up as well as try to aim for some more stretch goals. Also, my time management and organisation could have been much better during the course of this project.
